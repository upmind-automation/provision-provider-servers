# Workflow

This document outlines the development guidelines and basic workflow for implementing
new provision providers.

**Ensure you also read the guidelines on [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md).**

## Resources

Links/resources to familiarize yourself with before you begin.

- [Upmind Provision Provider Base](https://github.com/upmind-automation/provision-provider-base#readme)
  - This is the base library all provisioning code extends from. The project README explains the structure of Upmind provision providers; classes, responsibilities etc
- [Upmind Provision Workbench](https://github.com/upmind-automation/provision-workbench#readme)
  - A local development tool which provides a convenient UI for creating and managing provision configurations, running and inspecting provision functions etc

## Steps

Follow the below steps to create a new provider, using the fictitious provider "FooPlatform" as an example:

1. Install the [Upmind Provision Workbench](https://github.com/upmind-automation/provision-workbench#readme)
2. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/upmind-automation/provision-provider-servers)
3. Clone your fork into the `local/` directory where you have installed the provision workbench and run `composer require upmind/provision-provider-servers:@dev` - it will install from your fork in local/
4. In your fork of upmind/provision-provider-servers copy the `src/Example` directory to create `src/FooPlatform` and update the namespace on files under `src/FooPlatform`
5. Update the sample Configuration class for FooPlatform API credentials (hostname, username, api_key, sandbox, debug etc)
6. Bind your new provider to the provision registry in `src/LaravelServiceProvider.php`
7. In the provision workbench terminal re-cache your local provision registry by running `php artisan upmind:provision:cache`
8. In the provision workbench UI (typically http://127.0.0.1:9000) create a FooPlatform provision configuration
9. Now you can run provision functions (also known as provision requests) via the workbench UI as you develop them
10. When complete, submit your fork as a pull request (PR) back to the `main` branch on [this repository](https://github.com/upmind-automation/provision-provider-servers)

## Requirements

These are the acceptance criteria for new providers.

- Use the `src/Example/` directory as a basic template for the new provider; do **not** copy + paste an existing Provider class because each provider must be implemented differently
- Implement the Configuration DTO class (used to construct the provider) under the same namespace as the new Provider
- Implement PSR-3 debug logging of all API requests + responses
- Implement all provider functions where possible. E.g., where polling is not possible it’s fine to throw an error like “Operation not supported”
- Throw (or re-throw) normal/expected errors (e.g., data/state/auth issues) as a ProvisionFunctionError using `throw $this->errorResult()` - any other exceptions will be considered unexpected and wrapped in a generic error with a benign message which will be unhelpful to end users
- Result messages and error messages must be ‘safe’ for end users/customers to read (not contain potentially sensitive information such as  credentials or references to code/classes/files etc) but should still be reasonably helpful. Furthermore for services which can be resold as whitelabelled platforms you must **not** expose the provider/platform name in result/error messages
- Additional information or helpful metadata (e.g. raw API response data) should be returned in successful result debug or error data/debug
- Any changes to `src/Category.php` or in `src/Data/` must be discussed with Upmind prior to the PR
- Any new 3rd-party dependencies/libraries must be approved by Upmind
